# Mobile Money System (C Console Application)

## Overview

This project simulates a simple Mobile Money System using C programming language. The application allows users to interact with a menu-driven system, where they can send money, purchase airtime, make payments, and perform various other mobile money-related tasks. It demonstrates the use of `switch-case` statements, basic validation, and user input in C.

## Features

- **Send Money**: Users can send money to a mobile number or across regions (East Africa).
- **Airtime & Bundles**: Allows users to buy airtime, data, and other bundles.
- **MomoPay**: Accepts merchant code for payment.
- **Payments**: Offers multiple payment options including utilities, school fees, and more.
- **Savings & Loans**: Provides access to savings and loan services.
- **Financial Services**: Includes banking services like deposits and withdrawals.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows users to withdraw money from ATMs or Western Union.
- **My Account**: Provides options for checking balance, managing PIN, and viewing transactions.

## Program Flow

The program starts by displaying the main menu with 8 options. Based on the user's input, it navigates to the corresponding feature. Some of these features, such as **Send Money**, further ask for additional input (like mobile number and amount).

### Main Menu Options

1. **Send Money**
2. **Airtime & Bundles**
3. **MomoPay**
4. **Payments**

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mtn-mobile-money-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mtn-mobile-money-system

3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o mobile_money
